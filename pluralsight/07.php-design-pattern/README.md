# PHP Design Patterns

- Creational Pattern

  Provides object creation mecanism

- Structural Pattern

  Explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger, flexible structures

- Behavioral Pattern

  Deals with algorithms and assignment of responsibilities between objects

Overview:

- Importance of design patterns
- The creational design patterns
- The structural desgin patterns
- The behavioral design patterns

## 1. Understanding Design Patterns

Object Oriented Principle

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

Design Process

- Modules
- Libraries
- Frameworks

What is Design Patterns?

> Design patterns are solution to `real-world` problem, that
> often occur during software designing, in form of
> `blueprint`, well-proven, tested and `safe to follow`

Brief History

- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (The Book by the Gang of Four)
- 3 categories and 23 patterns

  - Creational Pattern

    - (\*) Factory Method
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype
    - (\*) Singleton

  - Structural Pattern

    - (\*) Adapter
    - Bridge
    - Composite
    - (\*) Decorator
    - Facade
    - Flyweight
    - Proxy

  - Behavioral Pattern

    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Command
    - Iterator
    - Mediator
    - Memento
    - (\*) Observer
    - State
    - (\*) Strategy
    - Template
    - Visitor

### 1.1. Design Patterns

- Definition
- Problem
- Solution
- Structural

> General solutions for common problems that crop up in all kinds of applications

### 1.2. Categories

- Creational pattern

Provides object creation mechanism

- Structural pattern

Explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger, flexible structures

- Behavioral Pattern

Deals with algorithms and assignment of responsibilities between objects

### 1.3. Design Principle vs. Design Pattern

|                      Design Principle | Design Pattern                                        |
| ------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------- |
|         Provide high level guidelines | Provide low-level solutions related to implementation |
| Aims for better software applications | Addresses commonly occurring object-oriented problems |
|     Aren't concrete - rather abstract | Are specific                                          |
|            Desirable goals to achieve | Tools used to realize the goals                       |

### 1.4. Design Principles

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Single Responsibility
- Open-closed
- Loose coupling
- Composition over Inhteritance
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Encapsulate what varies

### 1.5. Summary

- Design patterns are general solutions for common problems in software design
- These are blueprints, not algorithms or code
- Use `design pattern` to achieve the goals set by `design principle`
