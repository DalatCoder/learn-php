# PHP & MySQL: Novice to Ninja

> Build your own powerful web applications

## 1. Setup Local Development 

PHP is a server-side scripting language. You can think of it as a plugin for your web server that enables it to do more than just send exact copies of the files requested by web browsers. With PHP installed, your web server will be able to run little programs (called PHP scripts) that can do tasks like retrieve up-to-the-minute information from a database and use it to generate a web page on the fly, before sending it to the browser that requested it. Much of this book will focus on writing PHP scripts to do exactly that. 

MySQL is a `relational database management system`, or `RDBMS`. We'll discuss the exact role it plays and how it works later, but brefly, it's a software program that's able to organize and manage many pieces of information efficiently while keeping track of how all those pieces of information are related to each other. MySQL also makes that information really easy to access with server-side scripting languages such as PHP. And, like PHP, it's completely free for most uses.

When developing static websites, you can simply load your HTML files directly from your hard disk into your browser to see how they look. There's no web server software involved when you do this, which is find, because web browsers can read and understand HTML code all by themselves.

However, when it comes to dynamic websites built using PHP and MySQL, your web browser needs some help. Web browsers are unable to understand PHP scripts. Instead, PHP scripts contain instructions for a PHP-savvy web server to execute in order to generate the HTML code that browsers can understand.
